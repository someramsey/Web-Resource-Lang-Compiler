~Array Examples

let arr: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let exclusive: [1...5]; ~ Resolves to [1, 2, 3, 4]

let inclusive: [1..5]; ~ Resolves to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let stepping: [0...10^5]; ~ Has 5 steps and so resolves to [2, 4, 6, 8]

let color: [#ff0000...#00ff00^5:FLAT]; ~ Has 5 shades and uses default interpolation on RGB space

~Assignments aren't resolved unless they are used in a definition, this is just to show them in the output
