~Complex Assignment Example

let string: "a";
let number: 10;
let color: #ff0000;

let array: [string, number, color, "something else"];

let block: {
    a: string,
    b: number,
    c: color,
};

let otherBlock: {
    a: 10,
    b: otherBlock.a,
    c: [10, otherBlock.a...20, 200...300^10, array[2]]
};

let item: array[0]; ~ Resolves to "a"
